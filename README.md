# Wayfarer: A C# Unity Passion Project

## Introduction

**Wayfarer** is a single-player turn-based dungeon crawler game that runs in Windows. I wrote it in C# using Unity. It is the very definition of a passion project - I have spent two years developing it, with no intention of a public release. It was always just for myself and family and friends to play. During that time it has evolved in scope and complexity far beyond what I imagined when starting it.

## Game Overview

The core gameplay is that you start with a character with random traits, and have to win eight games to reach the title of Champion, at which point the character retires and you start with a new one. Each game is a snackable 15-30 minutes to play, and any items or gold you win a game with can be brought into the next one. So your character grows stronger with equipment and abilities as he progresses, but the challenges increase as you progress through the eight levels.

What makes Wayfarer unique is the sheer variety of things that can happen. Every game is completely unique and memorable and makes you want to tell someone about the crazy adventure you just had. This is achieved through multiple interacting complex systems combining with a high degree of randomness, which leads to emergent, entertaining and laugh-out-loud or gasp-out-loud experiences.

To give you an idea of the staggering depth and variety, there are:

- 14 different procedurally generated **landscape** types to explore (Catacombs, Forest, Citadel, Swamp, Desert, etc.)
- 17 different **landscape variations** (the catacombs or forest could be Frozen, Intense, Toxic, Sacred, etc.)
- 44 different **character classes** you can be, and 16 different fantasy **races**, each with unique advantages and disadvantages.
- 56 different **abilities** you can gain on winning a game to better equip you in subsequent ones.
- 255 unique **magic items** you can potentially find, use and keep.
- 48 **magic spells** you can potentially learn and cast.
- 56 classes of **NPCs** with different behaviours, skills and unpredictable personalities, along with a random name generator. Some will offer to join as a companion. Others will trade or attack.
- 57 unique **monster** types with a range of possible behaviours.
- 23 different **trap** types.
- 23 different **diseases** you can catch that temporarily debuff you until they are cured.
- 13 **Houses** you can align yourself with giving you optional extra challenges and rewards if you succeed.
- 96 **Chaos effects** - dramatic and fun gameplay variants that you can trigger or try to avoid.
- **Laws** that you always have the option of breaking with stiff penalties if you are then caught by a Sentinel.
- **Pacts** you can make with demons that give you one of 21 possible boons with one of 16 possible costs.
- **Religion** points you can accumulate to ask God to help you out in a fix, which he may or may not do.
- Magic portals, quests, rumours, limb damages, curio locations, ranged weapons, arcane events, legendary items, a luck system and more!
